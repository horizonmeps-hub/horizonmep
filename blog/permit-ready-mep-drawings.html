  <h1>What Makes an MEP Drawing Permit-Ready?</h1>
  <div class="meta">By Horizon MEP • Engineering Insights</div>

  <p>
    Permit delays are one of the most common reasons construction schedules slip.
    In many cases, the issue isn’t architectural scope — it’s incomplete or poorly
    coordinated MEP drawings.
  </p>

  <p>
    So what does “permit-ready” really mean from an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)
    perspective?
  </p>

  <h2>1. Code Compliance Is Clearly Documented</h2>
  <p>
    AHJs expect MEP drawings to explicitly demonstrate compliance with adopted codes
    such as IMC, IPC, NEC, NFPA, and local amendments. Missing references, unclear
    calculations, or generic notes often trigger review comments.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Load Calculations Are Included and Consistent</h2>
  <p>
    HVAC, electrical, and plumbing loads must align with equipment selections and
    schedules. Inconsistent loads between sheets are a red flag for reviewers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Systems Are Coordinated Across Disciplines</h2>
  <p>
    Permit reviewers routinely flag conflicts between mechanical, electrical,
    plumbing, and fire protection systems. Coordinated drawings reduce RFIs
    and demonstrate engineering diligence.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Life Safety Systems Are Fully Addressed</h2>
  <p>
    Fire alarm, sprinkler layouts, and egress-related systems must comply with NFPA
    standards and local fire department requirements. Missing life-safety details
    almost always delay approval.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Engineering Tip:</strong><br>
    Permit-ready drawings are not “minimum sets.” They are coordinated, reviewed,
    and structured to answer AHJ questions before they’re asked.
  </div>

  <h2>How Horizon MEP Supports Permit Approval</h2>
  <p>
    Horizon MEP prepares construction-ready MEP drawings with permitting in mind —
    from early code review through AHJ coordination and revisions.
